- _Decorator_ is a wrapper around a function that alters its behavior. The main job is still carried out by the function.

- Decorators can be seen as “features” or “aspects” that can be added to a function. We can add one or add many. And all this without changing its code

```javascript
function slow(x) {
  // there can be a heavy CPU-intensive job here
  alert(`Called with ${x}`);
  return x;
}

function cachingDecorator(func) {
  let cache = new Map();

  return function(x) {
    if (cache.has(x)) {    // if there's such key in cache
      return cache.get(x); // read the result from it
    }

    let result = func(x);  // otherwise call func

    cache.set(x, result);  // and cache (remember) the result
    return result;
  };
}

slow = cachingDecorator(slow);

alert( slow(1) ); // slow(1) is cached and the result returned
alert( "Again: " + slow(1) ); // slow(1) result returned from cache
```
