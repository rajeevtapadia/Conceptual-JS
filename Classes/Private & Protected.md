## Protecting with `__`
This is not enforced on the language level, but thereâ€™s a well-known convention between programmers that such properties and methods should not be accessed from the outside.
```javascript
class CoffeeMachine {
  _waterAmount = 0;

  set waterAmount(value) {
    if (value < 0) {
      value = 0;
    }
    this._waterAmount = value;
  }

  get waterAmount() {
    return this._waterAmount;
  }

  constructor(power) {
    this._power = power;
  }

}
// create the coffee machine
let coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine(100);
// add water
coffeeMachine.waterAmount = -10; // _waterAmount will become 0, not -10
```
Now the access is under control, so setting the water amount below zero becomes impossible.
NOTE: protected fields are inherited


## Private with `#`
Privates should start with `#`. They are only accessible from inside the class.
These properties are not inherited
```javascript
class CoffeeMachine {
  #waterLimit = 200;

  #fixWaterAmount(value) {
    if (value < 0) return 0;
    if (value > this.#waterLimit) return this.#waterLimit;
  }

  setWaterAmount(value) {
    this.#waterLimit = this.#fixWaterAmount(value);
  }

}

let coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine();

// can't access privates from outside of the class
coffeeMachine.#fixWaterAmount(123); // Error
coffeeMachine.#waterLimit = 1000; // Error
```
