- Primitives except `null` and `undefined` provide many helpful methods.
- Formally, these methods work via temporary objects, but JavaScript engines are well tuned to optimize that internally, so they are not expensive to call.
- The “object wrappers” are different for each primitive type and are called: `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Symbol` and `BigInt`. Thus, they provide different sets of methods.
